<h1>The Game Of Life</H1>

<h2> Intro </h2>
<font size = 2 face = Arial>

My Game of Life is an implementation of Conway's Rules of Life. These rules were a set of laws
governing the life cycles of single celled organisms on a grid. They were
invented by the mathematician John H Conway.<p>

The Game of Life takes place on a grid of cells. Ideally, the grid should
have infinite length and width, but this is not practically possible.<p>

Each cell has up to 8 neighbours. If a cell already is alive, and has more
than three neighbours, then it dies of overexposure. If it is alive and has
two or three neighbours, then it continues on, alive. If it has less than
2 neighbours, it dies of overexposure. If the cell is dead, and it has
exactly three neighbours, it respawns.<p>

This simple and elegant set of Rules, courtesy of Mr Conway, have been the
subject of several studies and a massive amount of computer simulations.
Currently, only one example of a formation not achievable from another
formation (ie has to be manually set up), that produces more and more cells
infinitely, has been found. It was called the 'Glider Gun' formation, found
by a group of MIT students. There is another theoretical pattern called the
"Garden of Eden", which has the same properties as the glider.<p>
 
<h2>'Playing' my Game</h2>
The following commands apply to the main screen in Life:<p>

Keys:<br>
 - Pressing 's' starts/stops the simulation.<br>
 - Pressing 'c' clears the grid of all active cells.<br>
 - Pressing 'd' switches between eraser mode.<br>
 - Pressing 'r' creates a random grid.<br>
 - Pressing 's' saves the current pattern of cells. (Not Implemented yet)<p>
 Pressing 1 through 9 loads predefined layouts

<p>
Mouse:<br>
 - Clicking on any cell will reverse it's current state.<br>
 - Dragging the mouse in draw mode will fill multiple cells.<br>
 - Dragging the mouse in erase mode will kill cells.<br>
 <p>
 There are a few sound effects if you have a soundcard ;-)

 Notes:<br>
 -The graphics do flicker a bit on slower PCs, that's because this isn't the doubleBuffering version (to 
  keep within the restraints of the restricted group)<br> 
 -I made a module to save the grid layout, but afterwards realised that an applet can't have
 write access to your HDD, that works in the application version.
<p> Oh, and it's not quite finished, time kinda ran out :P
